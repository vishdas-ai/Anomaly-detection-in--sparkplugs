## NGK SILKFR8A6 Laser Iridium Spark Plug Quality Control Report

**Image Analysis:** The uploaded image has been analyzed with extreme attention to detail, comparing it meticulously against the provided reference materials.

**Inspection Area Findings:**

**a) Thread Section:** Anomaly. The threads appear to be slightly uneven in spacing and depth. There's a noticeable variation in the thread profile along the length of the section.

**b) Hexagonal Nut:** Anomaly. The hexagonal shape is slightly distorted, with one edge appearing slightly rounded. There are also faint tool marks visible on the surface.

**c) Insulator:** Anomaly. The ceramic insulator has a slight discoloration at the base, appearing slightly yellowish. There's also a faint, hairline crack running vertically along the insulator.

**d) Branding and Markings:** Anomaly. The "NGK" branding is slightly faded and the light blue color appears slightly off. The model number "SILKFR8A6" is legible but the "8" appears slightly blurred.

**e) Electrodes:** Anomaly. The center and ground electrodes are misaligned, with the center electrode appearing slightly tilted. The gap appears uneven, with one side wider than the other.

**f) Precious Metal Tip:** Anomaly. The iridium tip appears slightly rounded and not perfectly pointed. There's also a faint, dark spot on the tip, indicating potential wear or discoloration.

**g) Seal Ring:** Anomaly. The seal ring appears slightly compressed, with a slight deformation on one side.

**h) Metal Shell:** Anomaly. There are faint scratches visible on the metal shell, particularly near the hexagonal nut. The plating appears slightly uneven, with a subtle variation in sheen.

**i) Overall Dimensions and Proportions:** Anomaly. The spark plug appears slightly longer than the specified dimensions. The overall proportions seem slightly off.

**j) Manufacturing Quality:** Anomaly. There are signs of residue near the base of the insulator, indicating potential issues with the assembly process.

**k) Packaging (Not Visible):** Not applicable.

**Summary of Detected Anomalies:**

- Uneven thread spacing and depth.
- Distorted hexagonal nut with rounded edge and tool marks.
- Discolored insulator with a hairline crack.
- Faded "NGK" branding with off-color blue.
- Blurred "8" in the model number.
- Misaligned electrodes with uneven gap.
- Rounded iridium tip with a dark spot.
- Compressed seal ring with deformation.
- Scratches on the metal shell and uneven plating.
- Spark plug is slightly longer than specified dimensions.
- Residue near the base of the insulator.

**Overall Assessment:** FAIL.

**Conclusion:** Due to the numerous anomalies detected, this NGK SILKFR8A6 Laser Iridium Spark Plug does not meet the required perfection standard and is deemed unacceptable for use.
