1. **Black Marks:** **Issue** - There are several black marks on the spark plug, particularly around the hexagonal nut and the metal shell. Some of these marks appear to be unintentional, likely from handling or storage. However, there is also a distinct black line running vertically along the side of the spark plug, which could be an intentional marker mark.
